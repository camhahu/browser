# Known Bugs
- the default screenshot file name should be an actual timestamp not whatever this is: .screenshots/2025-12-27-22-44-22.png
- now that viewport size is fullscreen by default, window size doesn't match it when opening in headed mode. making it look like the content is cut off the screen.
- screenshots always seems to add .png etc to the end (well the agent always seems to) we should fix that in a good way:w
- Started Chromium. Active tab: 539AB8B0A580CB8937AD015EF4DF1BC2 (should be new tabIds)
